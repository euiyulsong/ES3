# Maximizing Efficiency for Under- and Recent Graduate Students  
This is a data science project done for the University of Washington Intro to Data Science course. Our group sought out to understand the job search process of undergrad and recently graduated university students. The purpose of our analysis was to make recommendations to students regarding the actions they should take in order to reduce excess time and effort spent on job searching. Specifically, this includes which resources they should use the most and which skills they should prioritize developing in order to improve their job search process.
